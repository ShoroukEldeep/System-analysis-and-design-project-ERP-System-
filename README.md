# System-analysis-and-design-project-ERP-System-

#### I worked on this project with my team in the college to solve a realistic business problem in addition to practice of what we studied in the content of systems analysis and design.


### The Problem :
> Any financial transactions in most companies are difficult to 
be paper-based, especially large companies, with the internal and 
external financial transactions they contain. For this reason, one of 
them is that the human factor results in an error rate. It is difficult to 
calculate the percentage of 100. Secondly, if it depends on the human 
factor, it will be more expensive because I will need the number of 
workers More and more efficient, and thirdly, I will not be able to 
specify the company. You will gain or lose through transactions.

### The solution :
> Most companies, in order to avoid this problem, rely on 
software that manages all financial transactions, whether inside or 
outside the company, and provides graphs showing the state of the 
company, showing whether it is a gain, no loss, or equal percentages, 
and it knows payments belonging to any of its clients.

### System type :
> ERP System.
